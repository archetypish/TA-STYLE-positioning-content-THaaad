              In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats?
              In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
              storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
              granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
              markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
              are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance;
              still they are of great service.
            </p>
            <p class="article-para">
              How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
              awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is
              their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes
              this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
            </p>
            <p class="article-para indent">
              The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the
              mouse's hole.
            </p>
            <p class="article-para">
              A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp,
              resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any
              one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be
              delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a
              lasting and kind regard for them.
